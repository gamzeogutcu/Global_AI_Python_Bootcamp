# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Overview

This project is a Python implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. The goal of this project is to practice fundamental Python concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and user input. The game is designed to be played in the terminal, where the first player (either the user or the computer) to win two rounds is declared the winner of the game.

## Rules

1. The game is played in rounds. In each round, the player and the computer choose one of three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. The winner of the round is determined as follows:
   - Rock beats Scissors.
   - Scissors beats Paper.
   - Paper beats Rock.
   - If both the player and the computer choose the same option, the round is a tie.
3. The first player to win two rounds wins the game.
4. After each game, the player is asked if they would like to play another game. The computer also decides whether to play again randomly.

## Features

- User-friendly terminal interface.
- Randomized computer moves using Python's `random` module.
- The option to play multiple games with a running total of wins.
- Computer decides randomly whether to play again after each game.

## How to Play

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Clone the repository or download the script.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter:
   ```bash
   python rock_paper_scissors_GAMZE_OGUTCU.py
4.Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game.
